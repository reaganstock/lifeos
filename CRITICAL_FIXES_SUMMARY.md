# Critical Calendar AI Fixes - June 14, 2025

## Issues Reported by User

1. **Date Confusion**: AI using wrong dates (June 15th instead of June 14th for "today")
2. **Intelligent Reschedule Creating Duplicates**: Instead of moving existing events, AI was creating new duplicate events

## Fixes Implemented

### Fix 1: Date Parsing Logic Enhancement

**Problem**: The `parseDateTime` function was incorrectly handling numbered dates like "20th" by always using the current month, even if that date had already passed.

**Solution**: Enhanced the date parsing logic in `src/services/geminiService.ts`:

```typescript
// Before (buggy):
const day = parseInt(dayMatch[1]);
// Use current month
dateStr = `${currentYear}-${String(currentMonth + 1).padStart(2, '0')}-${String(day).padStart(2, '0')}`;

// After (fixed):
const day = parseInt(dayMatch[1]);
// Check if the date has already passed this month, if so use next month
const targetDate = new Date(currentYear, currentMonth, day);
if (targetDate < today) {
  // Date has passed, use next month
  const nextMonth = currentMonth + 1;
  const nextYear = nextMonth > 11 ? currentYear + 1 : currentYear;
  const adjustedMonth = nextMonth > 11 ? 0 : nextMonth;
  dateStr = `${nextYear}-${String(adjustedMonth + 1).padStart(2, '0')}-${String(day).padStart(2, '0')}`;
} else {
  // Date hasn't passed, use current month
  dateStr = `${currentYear}-${String(currentMonth + 1).padStart(2, '0')}-${String(day).padStart(2, '0')}`;
}
```

**Impact**: Now when users say "20th", it correctly determines whether to use this month or next month based on whether that date has already passed.

### Fix 2: Intelligent Reschedule Duplication Prevention

**Problem**: The `intelligentReschedule` function was creating new events with `generateUniqueId()` instead of updating the existing event.

**Solution**: Modified the intelligent reschedule logic to update the existing event:

```typescript
// Before (creating duplicate):
const rescheduledWorkout: Item = {
  ...canceledEvent!,
  id: this.generateUniqueId(), // ❌ Creates new ID = duplicate event
  dateTime: availableSlot,
  // ...
};

// After (updating existing):
const updatedWorkout: Item = {
  ...canceledEvent!,
  // ✅ Keep same ID = update existing event
  dateTime: availableSlot,
  metadata: {
    ...canceledEvent!.metadata,
    rescheduledFrom: canceledEvent!.dateTime?.toString(),
    rescheduleReason: 'Missed workout - automatically rescheduled'
  },
  updatedAt: new Date()
};
```

**Impact**: Now when users say "I missed my morning workout, reschedule it intelligently", the AI moves the existing event to a new time instead of creating a duplicate.

### Fix 3: Enhanced System Prompt Context

**Problem**: The AI wasn't getting clear enough context about the current date.

**Solution**: Enhanced the system prompt with explicit date context:

```typescript
CURRENT DATE/TIME CONTEXT - CRITICAL:
Today is: ${today.toLocaleDateString()} (${today.toISOString().split('T')[0]})
Current time: ${today.toLocaleString()}
When user says "today" or "TODAY", use: ${todayStr}
When user says "tomorrow", use: ${new Date(today.getTime() + 24 * 60 * 60 * 1000).toISOString().split('T')[0]}
```

**Impact**: The AI now has crystal clear context about what "today" means and should use the correct date consistently.

### Fix 4: Intelligent Rescheduling Documentation

**Problem**: The AI wasn't clear that intelligent rescheduling should move events, not duplicate them.

**Solution**: Added explicit documentation in the system prompt:

```typescript
INTELLIGENT RESCHEDULING - CRITICAL:
The intelligentReschedule function MOVES existing events to new times, it does NOT create duplicates.
- This function finds the existing event, removes it, and creates an updated version at a new time
- The result is ONE event moved to a better time, NOT two events
```

**Impact**: The AI now understands that intelligent rescheduling is about moving events, not creating new ones.

## Testing

Created `test-critical-fixes.js` to verify both fixes work correctly:

1. **Date Parsing Test**: Verifies that "today" uses the correct date
2. **Intelligent Reschedule Test**: Verifies that rescheduling moves events instead of duplicating them
3. **Event Count Validation**: Ensures the total number of events remains consistent

## Expected Results

After these fixes:

1. ✅ **Date Accuracy**: When users say "add workout for today at 6am", it should create the event for June 14th, not June 15th
2. ✅ **No Duplicates**: When users say "I missed my morning workout, reschedule it intelligently", it should move the existing 6am workout to a new time (like 7pm) without creating a duplicate
3. ✅ **Consistent Event Count**: The total number of events should remain the same after intelligent rescheduling
4. ✅ **Proper Time Updates**: The rescheduled event should have a different dateTime but the same ID and other properties

## Files Modified

- `src/services/geminiService.ts` - Core fixes for date parsing and intelligent rescheduling
- `test-critical-fixes.js` - Testing script to verify fixes work

## Next Steps

1. Test the fixes manually using the provided test script
2. Verify that both issues are resolved
3. Monitor for any edge cases or additional issues
