# OpenRouter Setup Guide

## Overview

This app now uses **OpenRouter** to provide access to multiple AI models including:

- **Claude Sonnet 4** (Anthropic) - State-of-the-art coding model (72.7% SWE-bench)
- **Claude Opus 4** (Anthropic) - Most powerful model for complex tasks (72.5% SWE-bench)  
- **GPT-4.1** (OpenAI) - Latest GPT model with improved efficiency
- **Gemini 2.5 Pro** (Google) - Advanced multimodal model with thinking capabilities
- **300+ other models** available through one API

## Why OpenRouter?

‚úÖ **One API key** for all models - no more juggling multiple accounts  
‚úÖ **No tier limitations** - bypass individual provider restrictions  
‚úÖ **Smart routing** - automatically selects the best model for each task  
‚úÖ **Cost effective** - only ~5% markup for massive convenience  
‚úÖ **Fallback system** - if one model is down, routes to another  

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Get Your OpenRouter API Key

1. Go to [OpenRouter](https://openrouter.ai)
2. Sign up for an account
3. Navigate to [API Keys](https://openrouter.ai/settings/keys)
4. Create a new API key
5. Add some credits to your account (you can start with $5-10)

### 2. Configure Environment Variable

Create a `.env` file in your project root and add:

```bash
REACT_APP_OPENROUTER_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
```

**Important**: Replace `your_api_key_here` with your actual OpenRouter API key.

### 3. Restart Your Development Server

```bash
npm start
```

## Using the Model Selector

Once configured, you'll see a **Model Selector** dropdown in the AI Assistant:

- **Claude Sonnet 4** - Best for coding and reasoning (state-of-the-art)
- **Claude Opus 4** - Most powerful for complex autonomous tasks
- **GPT-4.1** - Fast and efficient for general use
- **Gemini 2.5 Pro** - Advanced multimodal with video understanding
- **Gemini 2.5 Flash (Thinking)** - Fast with built-in reasoning capabilities

## Pricing (OpenRouter rates)
