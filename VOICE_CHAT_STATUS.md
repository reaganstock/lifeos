## üîß **Current Status:**

### **Gemini Live API is Available**
The Gemini Live API is **publicly available and working**. If you're experiencing connection issues, it's likely due to:

- **API Key Issues**: Invalid or missing API key in `.env` file
- **Network Problems**: Firewall, proxy, or internet connectivity issues
- **Rate Limiting**: Too many requests (though unlikely for initial testing)
- **Browser Issues**: WebSocket support or security restrictions

## üîç **Common Issues & Solutions:**

### **Connection Failures:**
1. **Check API Key**: Ensure `REACT_APP_GEMINI_API_KEY` is correctly set in `.env`
2. **Verify Network**: Test internet connection and check for firewalls
3. **Browser Console**: Check for detailed error messages in developer tools
4. **Rate Limits**: Wait a moment if you've been testing frequently

### **Authentication Errors:**
- Verify your API key is valid and has Live API access
- Check that the key hasn't expired or been revoked
- Ensure the key has proper permissions for WebSocket connections

## üõ†Ô∏è **What Happens When You Test:**

1. **Beautiful UI**: The voice chat modal opens with stunning visual effects
2. **Connection Attempt**: Tries to connect to Gemini Live API WebSocket
3. **Success Path**: Establishes connection and enables voice chat
4. **Error Path**: Shows helpful error message with troubleshooting steps

## üöÄ **Next Steps:**

### **If Connection Fails:**
1. **Check Console**: Look for specific error messages in browser developer tools
2. **Verify API Key**: Ensure it's correctly set and valid
3. **Test Network**: Try from different network or disable VPN/proxy
4. **Use Text Chat**: Fully functional alternative while troubleshooting

### **If Connection Succeeds:**
1. **Voice Input**: Speak into microphone for real-time transcription
2. **Voice Output**: Hear AI responses with natural speech
3. **Function Calling**: AI can perform actions in your life management system
4. **Real-time Interaction**: Natural conversation flow with interruption support
